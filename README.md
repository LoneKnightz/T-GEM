## 1. Environment setup 
[Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) is recommanded to set up the enviroment. 
you can simply install the necessary dependacy by using command 

  > conda env create -f transformer.yml 

you can set your enviroment names by change the first line of the transformer.yml . Details can be found at [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)
